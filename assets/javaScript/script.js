// Ready for fresh Code!!

// Here I will add an event listener for the click of the start button to begin the quiz

// Here I will add a function to present the first question and start the timer when the quiz begins

// Here I will add a function to present the second question after the first and so on

// I also need it so that when a question is answered the timer either stays the same or time is removed depending on if the answer is correct or not

// I need it to display the users score at the end of the quiz and provide a text box to enter the users initials and save them along with their score

// I need to save those scores to local storage and have them accesible for later viewing by clicking a link

// I need it to display "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT" at the bottom of the screen appropriately after each question is answered

// If all the above is done I need to ensure I am not missing any steps and that all the code is written as effeciently as possible
